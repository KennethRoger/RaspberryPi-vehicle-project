‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
This project was developed during college by a group of amateurs, and as such, it lacks professional coding practices. The entire codebase was written in a single Python file using the Flask framework ‚Äî yes, you read that right. It was not modularized, and we understand this may be painful to experienced developers. üòÖ

Unfortunately, the original code has been lost and is no longer available. If I manage to recover it from an old backup (I vaguely remember storing it somewhere), I‚Äôll update the repository.

In the meantime, you can refer to the project report [alkeak.pdf](./alkeak.pdf) ‚Äî the name is a mashup of our team initials. Check out page 47 for a one-page snapshot of the code. Do note: this isn't the final implementation (we later built an HTML-based remote control interface connected to Flask), but it‚Äôs fairly close in spirit.
